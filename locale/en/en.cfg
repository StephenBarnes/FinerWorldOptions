FinerWorldOptions-extension-plain=__1__ - multipliers (plain)
FinerWorldOptions-extension-squared=__1__ - multipliers (squared)
FinerWorldOptions-extension-cubed=__1__ - multipliers (cubed)

[autoplace-control-description]
FinerWorldOptions-extension-plain=Multiplies the options above. See the mod's startup settings to make this more powerful by squaring or cubing the numbers.
FinerWorldOptions-extension-squared=Multiplies the options above, twice. So if the frequency here is set to 300%, then the frequency of the resource above will be multiplied by 300% twice, for a total increase of 900%.
FinerWorldOptions-extension-cubed=Multiplies the options above, three times. So if the frequency here is set to 300%, then the frequency of the resource above will be multiplied by 300% three times, for a total increase of 2,700%.

[mod-setting-description]
FinerWorldOptions-multiplier-mode=Changes how powerful the "multiplier" settings are, when generating a new world. For example, if this is set to "cube then multiply", and the multiplier frequency is set to 300%, then the frequency will actually be multiplied by 300% three times, for a total increase of 2,700%.
